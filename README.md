[Alexa may answer your questions with ads soon](https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/14/alexa-answers-customer-questions-with-ads/)

Although many individuals with a technical background are reluctant to allow smart-speaker products such as Amazon Alexa and Google Home into their homes, the adoption of these products among the global middle class is growing at an astounding rate, with shipments of these products [estimated to surpass 200 million units annually by 2023](https://www.statista.com/topics/4748/smart-speakers/). Amazon plans to roll out a new feature to Alexa-enabled products in early 2023 called **Customers Ask Alexa**, enabling Alexa to respond to common questions such as "How can I remove pet hair from my carpet?" with product reccomendations from Amazon's top rated sellers. 

Having already hijacked a significant chunk of our attention with highly targeted online advertisements, Amazon will now advertise to us in our own homes, even when we are off of our devices. The rate at which tech behemoths such as Amazon, Meta, and Google are gobbling up more of our attention is alarming, as they learn more about our habits and attack the weakest psychological mechanisms that we have. I know that I personally will remain steadfast in my aversion to smart speaker technology. Let me know what you think!
